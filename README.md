### Description
Personal website of Ryan Zipprich. I began this project to provide relevancy to learning HTML and CSS. In addition to learning HTML and CSS,
I have begun using Git, GitHub, and markdown for the first time ever. This project is hosted through Google's Firebase web hosting.
I would really appreciate any feedback you have to offer about the design of the website or potential features to add. My intentions with the
site is to turn it into a digital portfolio with projects as I get older and also post life updates for my friends and family to see.

### Development
Development To-Do List:
  - [x] Home page & update resume for continuity
  - [ ] Rotational image on home page
  - [ ] About me, gallery, and quote of the week page
  - [ ] Implement databases, user authentication, and API(s) into website
